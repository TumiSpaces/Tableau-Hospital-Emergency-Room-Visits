# Hospital Emergency Room Data Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing data from a Hospital Emergency Room (ER) dataset using Tableau. The dataset includes various metrics such as the number of patients, average waiting time, visit times, gender distribution, patient age distribution, average patience, department referrals, and patients' race.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized data from a hospital's emergency room. It includes the following key features:

Number of patients: Total number of patients visiting the ER.
Average waiting time: The average time patients spend waiting before being seen by a healthcare provider.
Visit times: Time of day when patients visit the ER.
Gender: Distribution of patients by gender.
Age distribution: Number of patients categorized by age groups.
Average patience: The average time a patient spends in the ER.
Department referrals: Distribution of patients referred to different departments within the hospital.
Race: Distribution of patients by race/ethnicity.
Analysis and Visualization

Dashboard 1: Overview
Total Patients: A summary of the total number of patients in the ER.
Average Waiting Time: Visualization of the average waiting time for patients.
Visit Time Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of patient visits throughout the day.
Gender Distribution: Pie chart depicting the gender distribution of patients.
Patient Demographics
Age Distribution: displaying the number of patients by age group.
Average Patience by Age: Average patience (time spent in ER) categorized by age group.

Average Patience by Department: Average patience (time spent in ER) categorized by department.

## Conclusion
Through this data visualization analysis, we gain insights into various aspects of the hospital's emergency room operations, including patient demographics, waiting times, department referrals, and more. These visualizations can aid hospital administrators and healthcare providers in optimizing resource allocation, improving patient experiences, and enhancing overall ER efficiency.
